# Speed Test Game

A classic speed test that tests the player's reaction time. The player must click the correct key in the keyboard
as quickly as possible when the corresponding circle lights up in the screen. The high score of all attempts is 
saved and shown on the screen.

---

Frontend of the application has been made with React and TypeScript. The app is very frontend focused since the
backend is very simple and small. The high score is saved to a simple Firebase Firestore database. Inside
config and services directories can be found the code that handles the backend code. 

The hosting of the website is done with Netlify. The app can be found from
[speedtestgame.netlify.app/](https://speedtestgame.netlify.app/).
